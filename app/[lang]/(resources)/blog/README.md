    - **BlogNav.tsx**: Main navigation for blog section
    - **BlogTitle.tsx**: Title component for blog section
    - **categories/**: Category-based blog post filtering
        - **[category]/**: Dynamic routes for individual categories
    - **tags/**: Tag-based blog post filtering
        - **[tag]/**: Dynamic routes for individual tags
    - **layout.tsx**: Layout for blog pages with navigation

## Features

- **Content Organization**: Posts organized by categories and tags
- **Dynamic Routing**: Slug-based routing for individual posts
- **Navigation**: Consistent navigation with breadcrumbs and main nav
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for content while fetching
- **Layouts**: Separate layouts for list views versus individual posts

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Next.js dynamic routing for categories, tags, and post slugs
- Implements dedicated layout for consistent blog section UI
- Provides loading states for better user experience
- Separates navigation elements into dedicated components
- Organizes route structure for efficient SEO and content discovery

## Data Flow

- Blog content appears to be fetched from an external CMS
- Content is likely cached for performance (see contexts/CachedPosts.tsx)
- The structure supports pagination and filtering
- Components handle both successful content fetching and error states

## Development Guidelines

- Follow established naming conventions for new components
- Maintain consistency between list views and detail views
- Ensure proper SEO metadata for all blog pages
- Test loading states and error handling
- Consider performance optimizations for image-heavy blog posts
- Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes
- Preserve consistent typography and styling
