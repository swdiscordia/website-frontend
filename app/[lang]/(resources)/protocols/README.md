- Optimize for both technical and non-technical audiences
- Consider performance when loading protocol-specific resources
- Ensure all protocol information is properly categorized and searchable
- Update content when protocol integrations change or are enhanced
- Coordinate with protocol teams for accurate representation
- Include relevant risk disclosures where appropriate
